# Components
For this project, you will need:


* **ESP8266 (v01)**  - http://amzn.to/2u79UYY or https://goo.gl/feJq7w
* **Magnetic Switch**  - http://amzn.to/2HR0zGX or https://goo.gl/St6Zte
* **HW-655** ESP8266 Relay Board  - http://goo.gl/8ZhWXD


# Wiring
On the Relay module, you will need to solder the two ends of the magnetic switch to the GND and GPIO02 ( doesn't matter which to which). The picture shows the connection to the ESP8266 itself, but I found it eaiser to solder to the relay module instead. This way you can place/remove  ESP8266 freely.

The ESP8266 plug directly into the Relay module
